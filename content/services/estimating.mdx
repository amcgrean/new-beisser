## Turnaround Expectations
Standard takeoffs are scheduled on a first-in basis with timelines confirmed up front. If you have a bid deadline, let us know early and we will align the scope with what you need to submit on time.

For engineered wood, we coordinate with suppliers to ensure sizing meets plan requirements and local code before you receive your quote.
