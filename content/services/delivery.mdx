## How it Works
*   **Schedule by Phase**: Framing, exterior, and finish loads arrive when you need them.
*   **Dedicated Dispatch**: Contact our branch dispatchers to confirm dates and windows.
*   **Proof of Delivery**: Photos or signatures to document where materials were placed.
*   **Will Call**: Options available for quick pickups and small fills.

## Jobsite Readiness Tips
*   Share gate codes, onsite contacts, and preferred drop locations with your dispatcher.
*   Mark staging areas for framing, exterior, and trim packages so crews can move faster.
*   Confirm equipment needs (forklift, boom) for tight lots or multi-level projects.
*   Send quick photos of the lot if access or weather conditions have changed.
