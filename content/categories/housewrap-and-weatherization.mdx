name: Housewrap & Weatherization
summary: Systems that protect the building envelope from air and moisture.
description: >-
  A good wall starts behind the siding. Housewraps, flashings, and sealants work
  together to manage air and moisture before finish materials go on. Beisser
  Lumber helps builders build complete weatherization systems — not just
  housewrap rolls — with products that meet code, follow manufacturer best
  practices, and hold up to real jobsite conditions.
