The **Beisser Bowl** is one of our most recognizable community events—an annual high school football matchup between **Fort Dodge Senior High** and **Dallas Center–Grimes**.

The game debuted in 2023, followed by a 2024 rematch, and includes:

- A **handcrafted trophy** created by a Beisser employee.  
- **Donations to both schools’ booster clubs** in the name of each team’s MVP.  
- A strong show of community spirit and local involvement.  

This event represents what Beisser Lumber values most: celebrating students, supporting schools, and building strong community relationships.
