Beisser Lumber is proud to partner with **Greater Des Moines Habitat for Humanity** and other Habitat affiliates to support safe, affordable housing in our communities.

Our involvement includes:

- Supplying framing and building materials for Habitat projects.
- Coordinating Beisser volunteer crews for build days.
- Participating in programs like **Spring into Action**, helping ramp up volunteer and construction support as the building season begins.
- Providing delivery, logistics, and expertise to keep projects moving smoothly.

In 2024, Beisser Lumber received the **Habitat for Humanity Key Award**, recognizing our ongoing commitment to Habitat’s mission. For our team, this work is a natural extension of what we do every day: helping build quality homes for families across Iowa.
