title: Build My Future
summary: Hands-on construction career experiences for Iowa students.
---
**Build My Future** gives middle and high school students the chance to experience the construction trades up close. Instead of just hearing about careers in the industry, students get to pick up tools, try tasks, and talk directly with professionals.

At Build My Future events, Beisser Lumber helps by:1

* Providing materials and supplies for hands-on building stations.
* Setting up interactive displays that feature real framing, decking, and millwork components.
* Having Beisser team members on-site to answer questions and share their own career stories.
* Supporting partner builders, contractors, and educators who are investing in the next generation of tradespeople.

It feels good to do good—and it also helps the construction industry build a stronger future workforce. Our goal is that students walk away from Build My Future with new skills, new confidence, and a clearer picture of the opportunities available in the building materials and construction trades.
