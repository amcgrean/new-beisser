Beisser supports **Sleep in Heavenly Peace**, an organization working to provide beds, bedding, and support services to children in need.

Initiatives include:

- Participation in bed-building events  
- Material contributions  
- Awareness efforts connected to **Count the Kicks** and SIDS prevention  

We believe every child deserves comfort, safety, and dignity at home.
