The **Beisser Bowl** is one of our most recognizable community events—an annual high school football matchup between **Fort Dodge Senior High** and **Dallas Center–Grimes**.

The game debuted in 2023 and has quickly become a tradition the whole community looks forward to. Highlights include:

- A **handcrafted trophy** created by a Beisser employee.
- **Donations to both schools’ booster clubs** in the name of each team’s MVP.
- A strong show of community spirit, local pride, and friendly competition.

For Beisser Lumber, the Beisser Bowl is about more than a scoreboard. It is a chance to celebrate students, recognize the work of coaches and school staff, and bring families, customers, and employees together under the lights on Friday night.
