Beisser Lumber supports **Sleep in Heavenly Peace**, an organization focused on making sure that no child has to sleep on the floor. Through these partnerships, we help provide:

- Lumber and materials for bed-building events.
- Volunteer support from Beisser team members.
- Community awareness around the importance of safe, quality sleep environments for kids.

This work connects closely with initiatives like **Count the Kicks** and broader efforts around SIDS awareness and child wellness. Our role is simple: show up with materials, manpower, and encouragement so more children in our communities can have a safe, comfortable place to rest.
